The program being developed is intended to be able to scrape data from this genealogy site from which stats and analysis can be done.
As of writing (24/08/2024), it is effectively able to utilise threading to count all instances of unique first names and store and output them as a dictionary,
as well as count per year and per decade, with visualization of this data also possible using bar charts, i.e. checking most common names each decade.
Next steps for the project:
  - develop more potential for plotting using matplotlib/pyplot to visualize trends and quantities, such as most common surnames each decade by birth
  - implement some natural language processing, either with imported functions or home-made, to determine how many variations in names there were, i.e. Mary == Marie == Maria == Marion == Marian, Tom == Thomas, Jake == Jacob, etc.
