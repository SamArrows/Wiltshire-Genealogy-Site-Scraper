The program being developed is intended to be able to scrape data from this genealogy site from which stats and analysis can be done.
As of writing (05/08/2024), it is effectively able to utilise threading to count all instances of unique first names and store and output them as a dictionary.
Next steps for the project:
  - count names in relation to birth year (where they are supplied in the records), such that naming trends can be compared over time, i.e. 1700s vs 1800s
  - develop plots using matplotlib/pyplot to visualize trends and quantities
  - see which family names had the most members by numbers of births
